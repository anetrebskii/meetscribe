# MeetScribe Todo Items

## Completed

- [x] If user opens up the same meeting at the same day, then proceed transcription in that meeting
  - `meeting-store.ts`: `findSameDayMeeting()` + `resumeMeeting()`
  - `transcript-store.ts`: `restoreEntries()` to reload live buffer with dedup maps
  - `service-worker.ts`: `ensureMeeting()` checks for same-day ended meetings before creating new ones

- [x] Renamed meeting is not saved
  - `floating-popup.ts`: Set `m.title = newTitle` in blur handler so subsequent operations use updated title

  - `floating-popup.ts`: Replaced description line with `.participant-tag` chips, removed participant count from meta

- [x] Move action buttons somewhere in the meeting card
  - `floating-popup.ts`: Moved `.meeting-item-actions` inside `.meeting-item-header`, right-aligned with `margin-left: auto`

- [x] If I open Live meeting transcription should also have back button like archived one
  - `floating-popup.ts`: Added `.back-nav` element with compact "Meetings" button, shown only in live view

- [x] It should open transcription when I click meeting card, not only meeting title
  - `floating-popup.ts`: Changed `contentEditable` check to use `getAttribute('contenteditable')` for reliable detection

- [x] If recording then icon in the list of extensions should indicate it otherwise it should be grayed with tooltip
  - `service-worker.ts`: `updateExtensionIcon(isRecording)` using OffscreenCanvas, called on start/stop/startup

  - `popup.html` + `src/popup/popup.ts`: standalone dark-themed meetings list
  - `service-worker.ts`: dynamic popup routing via `tabs.onActivated`/`onUpdated`
